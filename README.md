## Introduction  
Meta-SNF is a metagene based similarity network fusion approach for multi-omics data integration, which first uses NMF to extract the underlying structures, defined as metagenes and separately for each data type, and then integrates different metagenes into a fused network under the SNF framework for further subtyping. It will be a useful tool to facilitate patient stratification for accurate treatment and early intervention.
